# HackAssembler
Repository for my C++-programmed Hack Machine Language Assembler 

This is a small, two-pass assembler for the NAND To Tetris course. 
It translates **only** Hack Machine Language as it was specifically made for the course.
The program must receive a .asm file and will create a .hack file.
I have the input commented, but just need to uncomment it if you want to type in your own files.
